# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
In this project we used several APIs to obtain and visualze data for a mock app called PlanMyTrip. We created a DataFrame with weather information, a travel destination map with hotel and waeather data, and a travel itinerary map with pop up information for a possible trip. The results of the analysis may be found in the folders Weather_Database, Vacation_Search, and Vacation_Itinerary.
